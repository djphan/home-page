        I'm a full stack developer with a background in <span class="strong blue-grey-text">web</span>, 
        <span class="strong blue-grey-text">software</span>, 
        <span class="strong blue-grey-text">bioinformatics</span>, 
        <span class="strong blue-grey-text">quality assurance (QA)</span>, and 
        <span class="strong blue-grey-text">infrastructure support</span>. I enjoy both front end and back end 
        work, and come with a variety of programming interests in areas such as software development, 
        data analytics, machine learning, and more!

        I appreciate what goes into developing a creative UX design and the challenges to balance  
        functionality and asthetics. As well delving into the full archetecture of a project provides insight -
        from data storage questions, how services may interact with it, and how the end user interacts with the software. 
        Greater understanding of the project comes from detailed understanding of all the components,
        and thus I am a <span class="strong blue-grey-text">full stack developer without preference to back-end 
        or front-end work/technologies.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        For my research interests, I am interested in <span class="strong blue-grey-text">genomics</span>, 
        <span class="strong blue-grey-text">genetics</span>, and <span class="strong blue-grey-text">systems biology</span>. 
        I'd be most interested in combining my background in computer science and genetics in an interdisciplinary 
        fashion in the next field of research.

        As for this website, this is meant to be a sandbox project where I get to try out a few cool 
        design concepts in a portfolio piece.
